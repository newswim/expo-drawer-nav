# expo.io with drawer and nativebase.io

This prof of concept project shows a expo.io react-native app with
drawer navigation, toolbar (with nativebase.io) and custom sidebar which
allows for dynamic content in the drawer/sidebar.

By having a dynamic sidebar, you can change the items in these based
on state (eg. after login, rename the LOGIN item to ACCOUNT).
